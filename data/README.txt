all of the states in the game

to make a state you just add an hscript file with the state's name and then you're good to go
if you need to you can make a folder with the state's name and then have multiple scripts running for that state
but you can still have an hscript file in just `data/*` if you want to
although it's coded to be the main script for that state so i'd suggest having a folder for external scripts for that state if you wanna go that route
